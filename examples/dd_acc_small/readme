Tests on maud/titan/vesta with lxi=7 and lxi=14 

   b64, b128, b256, b 512, b1024, b2048
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

=============
To compile:
    ../../bin/makenekmpi b

=============
To run the the following on 1 cpu:
    b64.rea
    b64.re2
    b64.map

    ../../bin/nek b64 1

   (note: those 3 files are generated from "base64.box; base64.rea")
   (note: thus to see how many elements in each direction, *.box has the info)

=============
To know the total number of elements:

     grep NEL b64.rea

     Based on the total E, you want to adjust (lelv, lelg, lp) in SIZEu 
  
     lxi: to be played what number allows ar max on Maud 
=============

We just want to print "interation#" at iocomm. So, please change the following prints at 

      if (nid.eq.0) then
           if ((mod(istep,iocomm).eq.0).or.(istep.le.10))  <-------------------- change this line as below
           if (mod(istep,iocomm).eq.0)                     <---------------------NEW change :  CAUTION!!!!
     $    write(6,9999) istep,iter,tolpss,etime_p,etime1
      endif

These are the files for those changes to be applied::

../../src/poisson.F: 1003 format(' ',i9,' cggo2   : iteration#',i5,l4,2x,1p3e12.4,
../../src/drift1.F: 9999 format('\n',' ',i9,' gmres   : iteration#',i5,1p3e12.4)
../../src/drift1.F: 9999 format('\n',' ',i9,' gmres_mg: iteration#',i5,1p5e12.4)
