Raw output files are found in the largeOutput and smallOutput folders.
The output files are named as comp_TYPE_np_work, where comp is the computer (titan, titan_large, maud, tesla), type is the processor type (MPI, GPU), np is the number of processors and work is the amount of work for the processors, in arbitrary units.

stripTiming.sh goes through the outputs to make a file with just timings.
Example use:

cd largeOutput
../stripTiming.sh titan_large GPU 0

The first 2 arguments point to the files to search. The first argument is the computer and the second argument is the processor type. The third argument is a switch between total computation and total communication. 0 = total computation, 1 = total communication.

timingPlot.py creates all of the 'small scale' plots, in linear, semilog, and log-log axis scales. It accepts one argument: saveIn. If saveIn == 0, the plots will be saved. If saveIn == 1, the plots will be interactive python plots.
Font and type of file (png,pdf,etc) can be controlled inside of the script.

titanLargeScalePlot.py plots all of the 'large scale' plots, including the weak scaling horizontal and weak scaling with communication plots. It accepts one argument: saveIn. If saveIn == 0, the plots will be saved. If saveIn == 1, the plots will be interactive python plots.
Font and type of file (png,pdf,etc) can be controlled inside of the script.
