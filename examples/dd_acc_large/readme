Examples: dd_acc_large
          Larger scale runs with E= 64, 512, 4096, 32768
          Should find an allowable maximum lxi= 15 or 14 or 13 or 12.... and 
          just use the maximum case of lxi for large scale runs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To compile: 

    ../../bin/makenekmpi bb

    (bb.usr = b.usr: your GPU version of 3dboxmult.usr)


To run on 1 CPU:

   ../../bin/nek bb64 1


To see the total number of elements:

           grep NEL bb64.rea


To set SIZEu:

     we will choose either lxi=12 or lxi=14 (the max allows)

     adjust (lxi,lelv,lelg,lp) in SIZEu

     nothing else to be changed in SIZEu.

To change parameters in bb64.rea

    currently without multigrid

    
    100 steps (param(17,21,24)=-1,2,2)


To run with multigrid:

    100 or 500 steps (param(17,21,24)=-1,3,2)
