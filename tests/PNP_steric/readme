With current setting:
You can run from lxi=2 for the following two cases. You can run on 1,2,4 cores.  


 1. ion_box1 (E=1000)

 2. ion_box2 (surrently E=4x4x4)

    - If you want E=3x3x3, You can change ion_box2.box -4,-4,-4 to -3,-3,-3.
    - It can be in the range from E=1x1x1 to E=10x10x10 in this curent setup. 
      (each direction can be different number; exach direction can vary from 1 to 10).


    - how to transfrom from the box to actual mesh:  

      cd tests/pqr3d/
      ~/Nek5000/bin/genbox (<--- how to create box mesh)
               then, input box file name as ion_box2.box 
               then it will produce "box.rea" with actual mesh data
            
      ~/Nek5000/bin/genmap (<--- how to get genbox for ion_box2)
               input>> it will ask 0.2 or other numbers. Just give default 0.2
               then, it will create box.map
               
      One you get box.rea & box.map, you can rename those as something else.
