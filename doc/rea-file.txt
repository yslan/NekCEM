What's in a .rea file?
----------------------

Contact: Andreas Kloeckner <andreas@mcs.anl.gov>

This file is parsed by reannotate, the automatic .rea file annotator.
For its sake, please leave the BEGIN_XXX and END_XXX annotations in
place.

The automatic REA file processors generally work best if there is a
unique symbolic name after the number of the parameter.

You may use enumerations "1,2,3,4" and ranges "11..17" to document
whole slews of parameters at once.

1) Real parameters
------------------

In a typical .rea, subtract 4 from the line number to obtain the parameter
number.

BEGIN_REAL_PARAMETERS

1    x CSPEED The speed of light, in m/s.

  If scale-free equations are used, this will be just 1.
  Usually, CSPEED = 1/sqrt(PERMIT*PERMEA)
  Physical value: 0.299792E+18

2    x PERMIT Vacuum permittivity (\epsilon_0)

  If scale-free equations are used, this will be just 1.
  Physical value: 0.885420E-20

3    x PERMEA Vacuum permeability (\mu_0)

  If scale-free equations are used, this will be just 1.

4    x IFTE (1), IFTM (2)

  1 for vacuum.
  This should really be a material property.

5   x IFMAXWELL=0,1,2,...;IFSCHROD=10,11,...; IFDRIFT=20,21,....,29;

  1 for vacuum.
  This should really be a material property.

6   x source turn on(1); turn off(0)

10   x FINTIME: Final Time
11   x NSTEPS: Total # of timesteps
12   x DT:  Timestep Size with (-), eg. -0.05; CFL number with (+), eg, CFL=0.2,0.3,0.4

13   x IOCOMM : Print statement at every IOCOMM step

  If this is set to 5, some statistics are printed every 5 steps.

14   x OPTIONS: number of periods (nano)

15   x IOSTEP : Produce outputs at every IOSTEP

  If this is set to 5, output is written every 5 steps.

16   x IFSOL: 1 (solution assgined), 0 (if not)
17   x Timestepping: -1(EIG),0 or 45(RK45),44(rk44),33(rk33),22(rk22), 1(EXP)
18   x Filter: 0 (no filter), 1 (turn on filter)
19   x FLUXES: 0 (upwind flux), 1 (central flux)
20   x ORDER (MESH): positive value

   if non-positive, prex kills to view the mesh

  0: Constant off
  1: Constant on
  2: Gaussian pulse at T0=P64, SIGMA=P65
  3: Cosine(2*pi*f*T) f=P64
  4: Sequence of pulses of pulse duration P64 and phase duration P65.

58  ---

  1: Constant 1
  2: Gaussian pulse
     localized at (P66..P68) initially
     travelling (P69..P71) per time unit
     with standard deviations (P72..P74)
       if one of the standard deviations is zero,
       the pulse is not localized in that direction
  3: Plane wave with wave vector (P66..P68)
     Freqency in P69
  4: APS source term
     Sigma of Z-Axis Gaussian in P66.
       If P66=0, no temporal/z modulation.
     Speed of bunch in P67 (in speed of light units)
       Must be != 0, even if no temporal/z modulation.
     Distance from center in P68.
     Sigma of radial Gaussian in P69.
     Number m of the azimuthal mode in P70.

  All fields (except APS) are normalized so that their peak value is 1.
  This field specifies additional scaling.

77  x PMLTHICK : thickness of the PML in levels

  Choose 1 if unsure.

78  x PMLORDER : polynomial order of the grading of the PML parameter sigma

  Choose 2 if unsure.

79  x PMLREFERR : PML reflection error

  This specifies how much of the incident signal is permitted to be
  reflected by the PML. See the term R(0) in formula (7.57) of the
  Taflove book.

  Choose 1e-5 if unsure.

80   x I/O: total (exact) number of output fields: currently default=4
81   x I/O: 0 (no output), 1 (fld),2 (posix ascii),3 (posix binary), 4,5, (coIO), 6,-6,8 (rbIO)
82   x I/O: the number of outputfiles per timestep
83   x I/O: frequency of restart output files, 0 (no restart output), #nn (iostep*nn)
84   x RESTART (should be 0 for non-mpi run): invoked with dump_number from the name of the restarting output file
85   x computation trace active if positive number
86   x io trace active if positive number
87   x I/O: "1" on BGP ;if >0, write/read restart files in float; if 0 (=default), double

88..89   ---
90..92   ---

  Whether to output these fields.
  Currently, this does not control the (via-Python) VTK output.

93   x ifdielec  0: false 1: true
94   x ific      0: false 1: true
95   x ifpoisson 0: false 1: true

96  ---

  Globally disable/enable all field output.

97  --- x ifarpack 0: false 1: true

  Whether to use ARPACK for eigenvalue calculations.
  ARPACK does not compute the complete set of eigenvalues,
  but it is much faster.

  This is only relevant if IFEIG is set.

98  ---
99  ---
100 x 0: default, 1: ifscat, 2: ifsftf
101 x ifdrude 0: false 1: true
102 ---

  Whether to use the given analytic solution given in the function usrsol.

  "Use" means as IC and BC, and also for comparison
  (i.e. error computation).

103 ---

  0: Write "old" PostX .fldNNN format
  1: Write vtkNNNN.dat files for postprocessing into VTK files
     by post2vtk

2) Logical switches
-------------------

BEGIN_SWITCHES

1 IFFLOW
2 IFHEAT
3 IFTRAN
4 IFSRC

  Whether to use the source term given in usersrc. (cf. .usr file)

5 IFCENTRAL

  Whether to use the central flux.

6 IFUPWIND

  Whether to use the upwind flux.

7 IFTM (2D only)

  Propagate TM wave (Hx,Hy,Ez).

8 IFTE (2D only)

  Propagate TE wave (Ex,Ey,Hz).

9 IFDEALIAS
10 IFRK4

  Whether to use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta time integrator.

11 IFEXP

  Whether to use the (currently non-working) Arnoldi-based time
  integrator.

12 IFEIG
13 IFNM

  Whether to run a "nanoscale" simulation.
  Nanoscale does weird things to the code that I don't understand.
  I gather that it introduces a more "reasonable" (?) scaling
  of small problems.
  Somebody who knows what this changes should elaborate here,
  and possibly list *all* the consequences of this switch.
  (Hint, Hint, Misun. ;-)
