What's in a .rea file?
----------------------

Contact: Andreas Kloeckner <andreas@mcs.anl.gov>

This file is parsed by reannotate, the automatic .rea file annotator.
For its sake, please leave the BEGIN_XXX and END_XXX annotations in
place.

The automatic REA file processors generally work best if there is a
unique symbolic name after the number of the parameter.

You may use enumerations "1,2,3,4" and ranges "11..17" to document
whole slews of parameters at once.

1) Real parameters
------------------

In a typical .rea, subtract 4 from the line number to obtain the parameter
number.

BEGIN_REAL_PARAMETERS

1 x CSPEED The speed of light, in m/s.

  If scale-free equations are used, this will be just 1.
  Usually, CSPEED = 1/sqrt(PERMIT*PERMEA)  
  Physical value: 0.299792E+18

2 x PERMIT Vacuum permittivity (\epsilon_0)

  If scale-free equations are used, this will be just 1.
  Physical value: 0.885420E-20

3 x PERMEA Vacuum permeability (\mu_0)

  If scale-free equations are used, this will be just 1.

4 x RELPERMIT Relative permittivity (\epsilon_r)

  1 for vacuum.
  This should really be a material property.

5 x RELPERMEA Relative permeability (\mu_r)

  1 for vacuum.
  This should really be a material property.

6 x GAMMA_P
7 x FREQ_P
8 x GAMMA_P

     travelling (P69..P71) per time unit

59 x SRCSCAL Source scaling

  All fields (except APS) are normalized so that their peak value is 1.
  This field specifies additional scaling.

  reflected by the PML. See the term R(0) in formula (7.57) of the
  Taflove book.

  Choose 1e-5 if unsure.

2) Logical switches
-------------------

BEGIN_SWITCHES

1 IFFLOW
2 IFHEAT
3 IFTRAN
4 IFSRC

  Whether to use the source term given in usersrc. (cf. .usr file)

5 IFCENTRAL

  Whether to use the central flux.

6 IFUPWIND

  Whether to use the upwind flux.

7 IFTM (2D only)

  Propagate TM wave (Hx,Hy,Ez).
  
8 IFTE (2D only)

  Propagate TE wave (Ex,Ey,Hz).

9 IFDEALIAS
10 IFRK4

  Whether to use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta time integrator.

11 IFEXP

  Whether to use the (currently non-working) Arnoldi-based time
  integrator.

12 IFEIG
13 IFNM

  Whether to run a "nanoscale" simulation.
  Nanoscale does weird things to the code that I don't understand.
  I gather that it introduces a more "reasonable" (?) scaling
  of small problems.
  Somebody who knows what this changes should elaborate here,
  and possibly list *all* the consequences of this switch.
  (Hint, Hint, Misun. ;-)
